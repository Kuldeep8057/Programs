7. Explain in brief about the nesting operators in emmet.

Ans. Nesting operators are used to position abbreviation elements inside generated tree: whether it should be placed inside or near the context element.

Child: >
You can use > operator to nest elements inside each other:
	div>ul>li

 <div>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</div>



Sibling: +
Use + operator to place elements near each other, on the same level:

div+p+bq
...will output

<div></div>
<p></p>
<blockquote></blockquote>




Climb-up: 
With > operator youâ€™re descending down the generated tree and positions of all sibling elements will be resolved against the most deepest element:

div+div>p>span+em 

...will be expanded to

<div></div>
<div>
    <p><span></span><em></em></p>
</div>
With ^ operator, you can climb one level up the tree and change context where following elements should appear:

div+div>p>span+em^bq
...outputs to

<div></div>
<div>
    <p><span></span><em></em></p>
    <blockquote></blockquote>
</div>

You can use as many ^ operators as you like, each operator will move one level up:

div+div>p>span+em^^^bq
...will output to

<div></div>
<div>
    <p><span></span><em></em></p>
</div>
<blockquote></blockquote>


Multiplication: *
With * operator you can define how many times element should be outputted:

ul>li*5
...outputs to

<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
